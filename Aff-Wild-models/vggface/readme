To build the CNN based on VGGFACE network, one should use the below python code:

import vggface_4096x4096x2 as net
##or import vggface_4096x2000x2 as net

network = net.VGGFace(batch_size)

## image_batch is a Tensor of shape (batch_size, 96, 96, 3) containing the images whose pixel intensities are within the range [-1,1] 

network.setup(image_batch)
prediction = network.get_output()
valence_val = prediction[:,0]
arousal_val = prediction[:,1]
