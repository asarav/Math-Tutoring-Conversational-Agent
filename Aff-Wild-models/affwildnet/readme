To build the AffWildNet VGGFACE-GRU network one should use the below python code:

import vggface_gru as net

network = net.VGGFace(batch_size,sequence_length)

## image_batch is a Tensor of shape (batch_size, sequence_length, 96, 96, 3) containing the images whose pixel intensities are within the range [-1,1] 
## sequence_length should be 80: when training we used sequences of length 80 (meaning 80 consecutive images from the same video) ; in the official Tensorflow documentation this is also called max_time
## batch_size is a number defining how many different sequences we have 

image_batch = tf.reshape(image_batch,[batch_size * sequence_length, 96, 96, 3])

network.setup(image_batch)
prediction = network.get_output()
valence_val = prediction[:,0]
arousal_val = prediction[:,1]
